		Are you ready to see some facts about me that are completely useless.
		Some facts about me that you do not know or really care about? Well
		here it goes. I am 5'11 and I weight about 145 pounds. I can speak 2
		languages and I am learning a third language! I previously tried to 
		learn Spanish but found Spanish to be quite boring and as such gave up.
		Well actually I only took that not to learn the language but to fulfill
		the 2 year language requirement in High School. What was the highschool
		I went to you may ask? I went to Curtis Senior High School in University
		Place, WA. Do you not know where that is? Well that's the place with the
		Golf Tournament in 2015~ Was this important at all? Not really. But was it
		fun to write? Not really. Did I waste my time to write text for this floating
		object? I sure as hell did. However I will do what I did in highschool for my
		rough drafts that were only checked for completion by amount of words and copy
		and paste this message again instead of writing alot. Are you ready to see some
